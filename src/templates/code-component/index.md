# üîß Code & Component Documentation Templates

Templates for documenting technical implementations that anyone can understand - from React components to utility functions to complex systems.

## üì¶ Available Templates

### [Component Template](./component-template.md)

**For React components, hooks, and UI elements**

Perfect for documenting:

- React components with props and usage examples
- Custom hooks and their functionality
- UI elements with styling and accessibility notes
- Interactive components with state management

_Use this when you're building reusable UI pieces that other developers will use._

---

### [Utility Template](./utility-template.md)

**For helper functions, libraries, and utilities**

Ideal for documenting:

- Helper functions and utilities
- Library integrations and wrappers
- Data transformation functions
- Reusable business logic

_Use this for standalone functions that solve specific problems._

---

### [Accessible Tech Template](./accessible-tech-doc-template.mdx)

**For comprehensive technical documentation anyone can understand**

Designed for documenting:

- Complex systems and services
- Technical processes with multiple steps
- Integrations between different parts of the system
- Features that affect multiple areas

_Use this when you need to explain something technical to both developers and non-technical stakeholders._

## üéØ Which Template Should I Use?

| **If you're documenting...**                | **Use this template**    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| A React component with props                | Component Template       |
| A utility function or helper                | Utility Template         |
| A complex system or service                 | Accessible Tech Template |
| Something with multiple integrations        | Accessible Tech Template |
| Code that non-developers need to understand | Accessible Tech Template |

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Choose your template** from the list above
2. **Copy the template content** from the appropriate file
3. **Replace the placeholder text** with your actual content
4. **Add mermaid diagrams** to explain complex concepts visually
5. **Test your documentation** by having someone else read it

## üìù Documentation Standards

All templates follow these principles:

- ‚úÖ **Accessible language** - anyone can understand the core concepts
- ‚úÖ **Visual diagrams** - complex ideas are shown with mermaid charts
- ‚úÖ **Real examples** - all code examples come from actual implementation
- ‚úÖ **Multiple audiences** - sections for developers, users, and stakeholders
- ‚úÖ **Consistent structure** - standardized sections and formatting
