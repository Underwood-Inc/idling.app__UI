# 🧪 Testing Strategies

Comprehensive testing documentation covering unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end testing, and continuous integration.

## 🔬 Unit Testing

**[Unit Testing](unit/)** - Component and function testing:

- Jest configuration and setup
- React Testing Library best practices
- Component testing strategies
- Mock implementations
- Test coverage requirements
- Snapshot testing guidelines

## 🌐 E2E Testing

**[End-to-End Testing](e2e/)** - Full application testing:

- Playwright configuration and setup
- User journey testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Visual regression testing
- Performance testing
- Mobile testing strategies

## 🔄 CI/CD

**[Continuous Integration](ci-cd/)** - Automated testing pipeline:

- GitHub Actions configuration
- Test automation workflows
- Quality gates and requirements
- Deployment testing
- Performance monitoring
- Security scanning

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

### Test Pyramid

1. **Unit Tests** (70%) - Fast, isolated, comprehensive
2. **Integration Tests** (20%) - Component interactions
3. **E2E Tests** (10%) - Critical user journeys

### Quality Standards

- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Performance**: Tests complete in under 5 minutes
- **Reliability**: Tests are deterministic and stable
- **Maintainability**: Clear, readable test code

## 🛠️ Testing Tools

### Unit Testing Stack

- **Jest** - Test runner and assertion library
- **React Testing Library** - Component testing utilities
- **MSW** - API mocking for integration tests
- **@testing-library/jest-dom** - Custom Jest matchers

### E2E Testing Stack

- **Playwright** - Cross-browser automation
- **Percy** - Visual regression testing
- **Lighthouse CI** - Performance testing
- **Axe** - Accessibility testing

## 📊 Test Reports

### Coverage Reports

- Line coverage: 85%+
- Branch coverage: 80%+
- Function coverage: 90%+
- Statement coverage: 85%+

### Performance Metrics

- Unit test execution: < 30 seconds
- E2E test execution: < 5 minutes
- CI pipeline completion: < 10 minutes

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **[Set up unit tests](unit/)** - Configure Jest and RTL
2. **[Configure E2E tests](e2e/)** - Set up Playwright
3. **[Enable CI/CD](ci-cd/)** - Automate testing pipeline
