version: '3.8'

services:
  # Only include essential services for Windows development
  postgres:
    # All settings inherited from docker-compose.yml
    
  nextjs:
    # All settings inherited from docker-compose.yml
    
  # Docs service is excluded to avoid canvas compilation issues on Windows/WSL2
