# 🔍 Documentation Link Audit

**Status**: In Progress  
**Started**: 2024-01-XX  
**Last Updated**: 2024-01-XX

## 🏗️ STRUCTURAL CHANGES COMPLETED

### Directory Restructuring

- **RENAMED**: `DOCS/` → `jekyll/` (better reflects Jekyll configuration purpose)
- **MOVED**: Component docs `jekyll/dev/components/` → `src/components/` (co-located)
- **MOVED**: Library docs `jekyll/dev/libraries/` → `src/lib/` (co-located)
- **MOVED**: API docs `jekyll/docs/api/` → `src/app/api/` (co-located)
- **MOVED**: Template files `jekyll/templates/` → `src/templates/` (co-located)
- **MOVED**: Community docs `jekyll/community/` → `community/` (root level)
- **MOVED**: General docs `jekyll/docs/` → `docs/` (root level)
- **MOVED**: Project docs `jekyll/project/` → root level (commits/, updates/)
- **MOVED**: Dev docs `jekyll/dev/database/`, `jekyll/dev/testing/`, `jekyll/dev/tools/` → `src/lib/` (co-located)
- **DELETED**: Duplicate index.md files where co-located versions already existed

### Co-location Benefits

- Documentation lives next to the code it documents
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better developer experience
- Reduced path complexity

## 📋 Audit Methodology

1. **Systematic File Review**: Check every `.md` file in DOCS directory
2. **Link Verification**: Test each internal link for existence
3. **Navigation Check**: Verify all navigation items work
4. **Index File Audit**: Ensure all index files have proper content
5. **Cross-Reference Check**: Verify relative path accuracy

## 📊 Audit Status

**FULL CODEBASE SCOPE**: 115 markdown files total (after restructuring)
**Jekyll directory**: 0 markdown files (pure Jekyll configuration now)
**Co-located documentation**: 81 files in src/
**Root-level documentation**: 27 files (community/, docs/, commits/, updates/, etc.)
**Files Audited**: 35/115 (30.4%)
**Links Checked**: 180+
**Broken Links Found**: 125+
**Working Links**: 55+
**Success Rate**: ~30% (STILL CATASTROPHIC)
**Empty Directories Found**: 12 confirmed

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### High Priority (Breaks Navigation)

- TBD

### Medium Priority (Broken Content Links)

- TBD

### Low Priority (Minor Issues)

- TBD

## 📊 Statistics

- **Files Audited**: 17 / 32
- **Links Checked**: 120+ / TBD
- **Broken Links**: 95+
- **Fixed Links**: 6 (community/contributing/index.md)
- **Empty Directories**: 12

## 🔧 Fix Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Fix critical navigation links
2. **Phase 2**: Address content links within sections
3. **Phase 3**: Handle empty directories (create content or remove links)
4. **Phase 4**: Verify all fixes work
5. **Phase 5**: Update navigation structure if needed

## 📞 Notes

- All links should use co-located documentation approach
- No new documents should be created unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer fixing links to existing content over creating new content
- Empty directories should either get content or have their links removed

---

**Next Steps**: Begin systematic file-by-file audit starting with community section.
