# User Guide: Living with Rate Limits

This guide helps you understand what to expect from our protection systems and how to have the best possible experience while using our application.

## üéØ What's Normal?

### Everyday Activities

These activities should never trigger rate limiting during normal use:

‚úÖ **Reading posts and comments**  
‚úÖ **Browsing different pages**  
‚úÖ **Logging in and out**  
‚úÖ **Posting comments and replies**  
‚úÖ **Uploading occasional files**  
‚úÖ **Using search features**  
‚úÖ **Updating your profile**

### Power User Activities

These might occasionally show brief delays if done very rapidly:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Uploading many files quickly**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Rapid-fire searching**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Bulk actions in admin panels**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Multiple simultaneous logins**

## üì± Different Experiences by Activity

**Normal use**: Search as much as you want  
**Heavy use**: 200 searches per minute before any limits  
**If limited**: Brief 1-minute cooldown

**Tips for heavy searchers:**

- Use more specific search terms
- Bookmark frequently accessed content
- Take short breaks between search sessions

### üì§ File Uploads

**Normal use**: Upload files as needed  
**Heavy use**: 5 uploads per minute before limits

**Tips for uploading lots of files:**

- Upload in small batches
- Wait a minute between large uploads
- Consider compressing large files

### üîê Account Security

**Normal use**: Login whenever you need  
**Heavy use**: 10 login attempts per 15 minutes  
**If limited**: 15-minute cooldown for security

**Tips for account access:**

- Use password managers to avoid typos
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Don't share account credentials

### ‚öôÔ∏è Admin Activities (If You're an Admin)

**Normal use**: Regular admin tasks work smoothly  
**Heavy use**: 50 admin actions per minute  
**If limited**: Brief pause between intensive operations

**Tips for admins:**

- Plan bulk operations during off-peak hours
- Use batch processing features when available
- Take breaks during intensive admin sessions

## üö¶ Understanding Rate Limit Messages

### Green Light: All Good

You won't see any messages - everything works normally.

### Yellow Light: Gentle Reminder

**Message**: "Please slow down a bit"  
**Meaning**: You're approaching limits but not there yet  
**Action**: Just continue normally, maybe a bit slower

### Red Light: Brief Pause

**Message**: "Too many requests. Please wait X seconds."  
**Meaning**: You've hit a limit and need to wait  
**Action**: Wait the specified time, then continue

### Stop Sign: Security Concern

**Message**: "Suspicious activity detected. Access temporarily restricted."  
**Meaning**: The system detected unusual patterns  
**Action**: Wait longer, then contact support if it continues

## ‚è∞ Wait Times Explained

- **Reason**: Gentle introduction to limits
- **Recovery**: Quick return to normal access

### Repeated Limits

- **Wait time**: 2-8 minutes (increases each time)

## üîß Avoiding Common Issues

**Solution**: Wait the specified time, then resume

### Search Frustrations

**Issue**: "Search temporarily limited"
