# 🧪 Skeleton Dev Tools Testing Guide

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. **Access the Dev Tools**
- Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- Navigate to `/posts` or `/my-posts`
- Look for floating blue button in bottom-right corner
- Click it OR press `Ctrl+Shift+S`

### 2. **Visual Indicators**
- **Blue FAB**: Normal mode
- **Green FAB**: Dev mode active
- **Red pulsing dot**: Override is active
- **Toast notifications**: Show mode changes

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Force ON Mode**
**Purpose**: See skeleton designs without waiting for loading

1. Open dev panel (`Ctrl+Shift+S`)
2. Select "Force ON" radio button
3. **Expected Results**:
   - Toast shows: "🟢 Skeleton: FORCE-ON"
   - FAB turns green with red pulsing dot
   - Console logs: `🎛️ [DEV SKELETON] 🟢 Mode changed to: FORCE-ON`
   - **Skeleton overlay appears over content** with white semi-transparent background
   - Content becomes dimmed and non-interactive
   - Skeletons match the actual layout structure

### **Scenario 2: Force OFF Mode** 
**Purpose**: Test content layouts without skeleton interference

1. Select "Force OFF" radio button
2. Trigger loading (click a tag filter or change pages)
3. **Expected Results**:
   - Toast shows: "🔴 Skeleton: FORCE-OFF" 
   - FAB turns green with red dot
   - Console logs: `🎛️ [DEV SKELETON] 🔴 Mode changed to: FORCE-OFF`
   - **No skeletons show during loading**
   - Instead shows: "🔄 Loading submissions... ⚠️ Dev Mode: Skeletons are disabled"

### **Scenario 3: Auto Mode (Default)**
**Purpose**: Verify normal loading behavior

1. Select "Auto (Default)" radio button
2. Trigger loading by filtering or navigation
3. **Expected Results**:
   - Toast shows: "🔵 Skeleton: AUTO"
   - FAB returns to normal blue color
   - Console logs: `🎛️ [DEV SKELETON] 🔵 Mode changed to: AUTO`
   - **Normal skeleton behavior**: Shows during loading, hides when content loads

## 🔍 Detailed Testing

### **Loading State Transitions**

#### Test A: Initial Page Load
1. **Auto Mode**: Shows fallback skeleton → content loads → skeleton disappears
2. **Force ON**: Shows skeleton overlay over content immediately  
3. **Force OFF**: Shows loading message instead of skeleton

#### Test B: Filter Changes
1. Click any tag in the posts list
2. Observe loading behavior based on current mode
3. Check that smart skeleton (if captured) matches previous layout

#### Test C: Pagination
1. Change page or page size
2. Verify skeleton behavior follows dev mode settings
3. Smart skeleton should maintain consistent structure

### **Smart Skeleton Capture**

#### Test D: Layout Capture
1. Load posts with content
2. Check console for: `📸 [SKELETON] Captured layout: {...}`
3. Filter to trigger reload
4. Verify skeleton matches captured layout structure

#### Test E: Fallback Behavior
1. Clear browser cache to reset captured layout
2. Reload page and trigger loading
3. Should show generic fallback skeleton initially
4. After content loads, next loading should use smart skeleton

## 🎨 Visual Verification

### **Force ON Mode Appearance**
- Skeleton has white semi-transparent overlay (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)`)
- Original content visible but dimmed (`opacity: 0.3`)
- Content is non-interactive (`pointer-events: none`)
- Skeleton structure matches real content layout

### **Skeleton Structure Matching**
Check that skeletons include:
- Correct number of submission cards
- Pagination skeleton (if pagination exists)
- Thread reply skeletons (if in thread mode)
- Tag placeholders with realistic variation
- Proper spacing and alignment

## 🔧 Console Output

### **Expected Console Messages**

#### Mode Changes:
```
🎛️ [DEV SKELETON] 🟢 Mode changed to: FORCE-ON
🎛️ [DEV SKELETON] 🔴 Mode changed to: FORCE-OFF  
🎛️ [DEV SKELETON] 🔵 Mode changed to: AUTO
```

#### Layout Capture:
```
📸 [SKELETON] Captured layout: {
  submissionCount: 5,
  showPagination: true,
  enableThreadMode: false
}
```

#### Component Rendering:
```
📋 [SUBMISSIONS_LIST] Rendering with state: {
  submissionsCount: 5,
  isLoading: false,
  hasError: false,
  ...
}
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases to Test

### **Edge Case 1: Empty Results**
1. Apply filters that return no results
2. Verify appropriate empty state message
3. Force ON should still show skeleton overlay

### **Edge Case 2: Error States**  
1. Simulate network error (disconnect internet)
2. Verify error message shows correctly
3. Force ON mode should override error display

### **Edge Case 3: Rapid Mode Changes**
1. Quickly switch between all three modes
2. Verify toasts don't stack up
3. State should always reflect latest selection

### **Edge Case 4: Keyboard Shortcuts**
1. Test `Ctrl+Shift+S` shortcut works consistently
2. Verify it doesn't conflict with browser shortcuts
3. Panel should toggle visibility correctly

## ✅ Success Criteria

The dev tools are working correctly if:

1. **All three modes behave distinctly**:
   - Auto: Normal loading behavior
   - Force ON: Always shows skeletons (overlay when content exists)
   - Force OFF: Never shows skeletons (even during loading)

2. **Visual feedback is clear**:
   - FAB color changes
   - Toast notifications appear
   - Console logs are descriptive

3. **Smart skeleton adaptation works**:
   - Layout capture after successful loads
   - Skeletons match actual content structure
   - Graceful fallback for edge cases

4. **No production leakage**:
   - Dev tools only visible in development
   - Production builds exclude all dev code
   - Performance unaffected in production

## 🚨 Common Issues

### **Controls Don't Work**
- Check console for import errors
- Verify `NODE_ENV=development`
- Ensure dev server running (not production build)

### **Skeleton Doesn't Match Layout**
- Clear browser cache to reset captured layout
- Check if content structure changed
- Verify smart skeleton capture in console

### **Toast Notifications Missing**
- Check if JavaScript errors are blocking execution
- Verify browser allows style injection
- Try refreshing page

## 🎉 Ready for Production

Once testing is complete:
1. Run `npm run build` to verify dev tools are excluded
2. Search build output for dev tool references (should find none)  
3. Test production deployment (no dev controls should appear)
4. Verify normal skeleton behavior works in production

The skeleton system is now fully integrated with powerful development controls!
