# üìä Monitoring and Alerts Guide

This guide helps you keep track of your idling.app's health and performance. We'll show you how to monitor everything and get alerts when something needs attention.

## üéØ What We Monitor

Think of monitoring like having a dashboard in your car - it tells you important information about how everything is running:

### Application Health
- **Is the app running?** (like checking if your engine is on)
- **How fast is it responding?** (like checking your speedometer)
- **Are there any errors?** (like warning lights on your dashboard)

### Database Performance
- **How much data do we have?** (like checking your fuel gauge)
- **How fast are database queries?** (like checking if your engine is running smoothly)
- **Are there any connection issues?** (like checking if all parts are connected)

### Server Resources
- **CPU usage** (how hard your computer is working)
- **Memory usage** (how much computer memory we're using)
- **Disk space** (how much storage space is left)

## üîß Setting Up Basic Monitoring

### 1. PM2 Built-in Monitoring

PM2 (the tool that keeps our app running) has built-in monitoring:

```bash
# See current status of your app
pm2 status

# Watch real-time performance
pm2 monit

# View detailed logs
pm2 logs idling-app

# Check app uptime and restarts
pm2 info idling-app
```

**What this shows you:**
- **Status**: Is your app running or stopped?
- **CPU %**: How much processing power it's using
- **Memory**: How much RAM it's using
- **Uptime**: How long it's been running without issues
- **Restarts**: How many times it had to restart (fewer is better)

### 2. Server Resource Monitoring

Check your server's health with these simple commands:

```bash
# Check overall system performance
htop

# Check disk space (make sure you don't run out!)
df -h

# Check memory usage
free -h

# Check running processes
ps aux
```

**What to look for:**
- **Disk space**: Should stay below 80% full
- **Memory**: Should not be consistently above 90%
- **CPU**: Brief spikes are normal, but constant high usage isn't

### 3. Database Health Monitoring

Keep an eye on your database:

```bash
# Connect to your database
sudo -u postgres psql mydatabase

# Check database size
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('mydatabase'));

# Check number of active connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

# Check recent activity
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';

# Exit database
\q
```

**What this tells you:**
- **Database size**: How much data you're storing
- **Connections**: How many apps are connected to your database
- **Active queries**: What the database is currently doing

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Application Response Times

Create a simple script to check how fast your app responds:

```bash
# Create a monitoring script
nano ~/check-app-speed.sh
```

Add this content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Checking app response time..."
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "Response time: %{time_total} seconds\n" https://yourdomain.com
```

Make it executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x ~/check-app-speed.sh
./check-app-speed.sh
```

**Good response times:**
- **Under 1 second**: Excellent
- **1-3 seconds**: Good
- **3-5 seconds**: Acceptable
- **Over 5 seconds**: Needs investigation

### Cache Performance

Check how well your caching is working:

```bash
# Check PM2 app statistics
pm2 show idling-app
```

Look for:
- **Low restart count**: Cache is working well
- **Stable memory usage**: No memory leaks
- **Consistent CPU usage**: No performance issues

## üö® Setting Up Alerts

### Simple Email Alerts

Create a script that emails you when something goes wrong:

```bash
# Install mail utility
sudo apt install mailutils

# Create alert script
nano ~/alert-script.sh
```

Add this content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
APP_STATUS=$(pm2 status idling-app | grep -c "online")
DISK_USAGE=$(df / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//g')

if [ $APP_STATUS -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "App is down!" | mail -s "ALERT: Idling App Down" your-email@example.com
fi

if [ $DISK_USAGE -gt 90 ]; then
    echo "Disk usage is at ${DISK_USAGE}%" | mail -s "ALERT: Low Disk Space" your-email@example.com
fi
```

**What this does:**
- Checks if your app is running
- Checks if disk space is getting low
- Sends you an email if there's a problem

### Set Up Automatic Checking

Make the script run automatically every 5 minutes:

```bash
# Open the task scheduler
crontab -e

# Add this line to check every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /home/youruser/alert-script.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Runs your alert script every 5 minutes
- You'll get an email if something is wrong
- You don't have to manually check all the time

## üìä Log Analysis

### Understanding Your Logs

Your app creates logs (like a diary of what it's doing). Here's how to read them:

```bash
# View recent app logs
pm2 logs idling-app --lines 100

# View only error logs
pm2 logs idling-app --err

# Follow logs in real-time (press Ctrl+C to stop)
pm2 logs idling-app --lines 0
```

**Types of log messages:**
- **INFO**: Normal operation (usually green)
- **WARN**: Something unusual but not critical (usually yellow)
- **ERROR**: Something went wrong (usually red)

### Common Error Patterns

**Database connection errors:**
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432
```
**Solution:** Check if PostgreSQL is running: `sudo systemctl status postgresql`

**Out of memory errors:**
```
FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit
```
**Solution:** Your app needs more memory or has a memory leak

**Port already in use:**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```
**Solution:** Another process is using port 3000

## üì± Advanced Monitoring (Optional)

### Using PM2 Plus (Free Monitoring Service)

PM2 Plus gives you a web dashboard to monitor your app:

```bash
# Sign up for PM2 Plus (free)
pm2 plus

# Follow the instructions to link your app
```

**Benefits:**
- Monitor from anywhere with internet
- Get email/SMS alerts
- See performance graphs
- Monitor multiple servers

### Simple Health Check Endpoint

You can add a simple health check to your app (this requires minimal code change):

Create a simple HTML file that shows your app is working:

```bash
# Create a simple health check page
echo "<html><body><h1>App is running!</h1><p>Last checked: $(date)</p></body></html>" > ~/repos/idling.app__UI/public/health.html
```

Then you can check: `https://yourdomain.com/health.html`

## üîç Troubleshooting Monitoring Issues

### Monitoring Script Not Working

**Check if the script is executable:**
```bash
ls -la ~/alert-script.sh
# Should show: -rwxr-xr-x (the 'x' means executable)
```

**Test the script manually:**
```bash
~/alert-script.sh
```

**Check if cron is running:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status cron
```

### Not Receiving Email Alerts

**Test email sending:**
```bash
echo "Test message" | mail -s "Test Subject" your-email@example.com
```

**Check mail logs:**
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/mail.log
```

### Performance Issues

**If your app is slow:**
1. Check `pm2 monit` for high CPU/memory usage
2. Check `pm2 logs` for error messages
3. Check database performance with the SQL queries above
4. Check disk space with `df -h`

**If your server is slow:**
1. Check `htop` for resource usage
2. Check `df -h` for disk space
3. Check `free -h` for memory usage

## üìã Daily Monitoring Checklist

Create a simple daily routine:

### Morning Check (2 minutes)
1. **Check app status**: `pm2 status`
2. **Check recent logs**: `pm2 logs idling-app --lines 20`
3. **Check disk space**: `df -h`
4. **Visit your website**: Make sure it loads properly

### Weekly Check (5 minutes)
1. **Check database size**: Run the database monitoring queries
2. **Review error logs**: Look for patterns in errors
3. **Check server updates**: `sudo apt list --upgradable`
4. **Test backup systems**: Make sure your backups are working

### Monthly Check (10 minutes)
1. **Review performance trends**: Has anything gotten slower?
2. **Check SSL certificate**: Make sure it's not expiring soon
3. **Update dependencies**: `yarn outdated` to see what can be updated
4. **Review user feedback**: Any performance complaints?

## üéØ Key Metrics to Watch

### Critical Metrics (Check Daily)
- **App uptime**: Should be close to 100%
- **Response time**: Should be under 3 seconds
- **Error rate**: Should be very low (less than 1%)
- **Disk space**: Should be under 80%

### Important Metrics (Check Weekly)
- **Database size growth**: Should be predictable
- **Memory usage trends**: Should be stable
- **Number of users**: Growth is good!
- **Popular features**: Which parts of your app are used most?

### Nice-to-Know Metrics (Check Monthly)
- **Server costs**: Are they reasonable?
- **Feature usage**: Which features are popular?
- **User retention**: Are users coming back?
- **Performance improvements**: Is the app getting faster?
