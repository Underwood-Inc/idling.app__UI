# ‚ö° Performance Optimization Guide

This guide helps you make your idling.app run faster and provide a better experience for your users. We'll explain everything in simple terms so anyone can understand and apply these optimizations.

## üéØ Why Performance Matters

Think of performance like the speed of service at a restaurant:
- **Fast service** = Happy customers who come back
- **Slow service** = Frustrated customers who leave
- **Reliable service** = Customers trust your restaurant

For your app:
- **Fast loading** = Users enjoy using your app
- **Quick responses** = Users can get things done efficiently
- **Reliable performance** = Users trust your app with their time

## üìä Understanding Performance Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

**Response Time** (How fast your app responds)
- **Under 1 second**: Excellent - users feel the app is instant
- **1-3 seconds**: Good - users are comfortable waiting
- **3-5 seconds**: Acceptable - users might get impatient
- **Over 5 seconds**: Poor - users will likely leave

**Memory Usage** (How much computer memory your app uses)
- **Under 100MB**: Excellent for small apps
- **100-500MB**: Normal for medium apps
- **500MB-1GB**: High but acceptable for large apps
- **Over 1GB**: Needs optimization

**CPU Usage** (How hard your server works)
- **Under 20%**: Very light load
- **20-50%**: Normal load
- **50-80%**: Heavy load but manageable
- **Over 80%**: Need to optimize or upgrade

## üöÄ Frontend Performance Optimizations

### 1. Image Optimization

Images often make up most of your page's loading time. Here's how to optimize them:

**Use the Right Image Formats:**
```bash
# Convert large images to WebP format (smaller file size)
# Install ImageMagick first:
sudo apt install imagemagick

# Convert PNG/JPG to WebP
convert original-image.jpg -quality 80 optimized-image.webp
```

**Resize Images Appropriately:**
- **Hero images**: 1920x1080 max
- **Profile pictures**: 200x200 max
- **Thumbnails**: 150x150 max
- **Icons**: 32x32 or 64x64

**Image Optimization Checklist:**
- ‚úÖ Compress images before uploading
- ‚úÖ Use WebP format when possible
- ‚úÖ Don't use images larger than needed
- ‚úÖ Consider lazy loading for images below the fold

### 2. Code Optimization

**Minimize JavaScript and CSS:**
Your app automatically does this when you build for production:

```bash
# Build optimized version
yarn build

# This creates minified (compressed) files in .next folder
```

**Remove Unused Code:**
```bash
# Check for unused dependencies
yarn depcheck

# Remove packages you're not using
yarn remove package-name
```

**Bundle Analysis:**
See what's making your app large:

```bash
# Install bundle analyzer
yarn add --dev @next/bundle-analyzer

# Add to package.json scripts:
"analyze": "ANALYZE=true yarn build"

# Run analysis
yarn analyze
```

### 3. Caching Strategies

**Browser Caching:**
Your app automatically sets good cache headers for:
- Static assets (CSS, JS, images): cached for 1 year
- HTML pages: cached for 1 hour
- API responses: cached for 1 minute

**Service Worker Caching:**
Your app includes a service worker that:
- Caches important files for offline use
- Updates cache when you deploy new versions
- Provides faster loading for repeat visitors

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Performance Optimizations

### 1. Query Optimization

**Use Efficient Queries:**
Instead of loading all data and filtering in JavaScript, filter in the database:

```sql
-- Good: Filter in database
SELECT * FROM submissions 
WHERE author = 'username' 
AND submission_datetime > '2024-01-01'
LIMIT 20;

-- Bad: Load everything then filter
SELECT * FROM submissions;
-- Then filter in JavaScript
```

**Use Indexes for Fast Searches:**
Your database already has indexes for common searches:
- Author searches
- Tag searches  
- Date-based searches
- Title searches

**Check Index Usage:**
```sql
-- See which indexes are being used
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan 
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

### 2. Connection Management

**Monitor Database Connections:**
```bash
# Check active connections
sudo -u postgres psql mydatabase -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# See what connections are doing
sudo -u postgres psql mydatabase -c "SELECT state, count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity GROUP BY state;"
```

**Optimize Connection Settings:**
Your app uses connection pooling to efficiently manage database connections.

### 3. Database Maintenance

**Regular Maintenance Tasks:**

```bash
# Create a maintenance script
nano ~/db-maintenance.sh
```

Add this content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting database maintenance..."

# Update table statistics (helps with query planning)
sudo -u postgres psql mydatabase -c "ANALYZE;"

# Clean up dead rows
sudo -u postgres psql mydatabase -c "VACUUM ANALYZE;"

# Reindex for better performance
sudo -u postgres psql mydatabase -c "REINDEX DATABASE mydatabase;"

echo "Database maintenance completed!"
```

Run weekly:
```bash
chmod +x ~/db-maintenance.sh
# Add to crontab to run every Sunday at 2 AM
echo "0 2 * * 0 /home/youruser/db-maintenance.sh" | crontab -
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Server Performance Optimizations

### 1. Memory Management

**Monitor Memory Usage:**
```bash
# Check current memory usage
free -h

# Check which processes use most memory
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10

# Check your app's memory usage
pm2 show idling-app
```

**Optimize Memory Settings:**
```bash
# Set Node.js memory limits
pm2 delete idling-app
pm2 start yarn --name "idling-app" --node-args="--max-old-space-size=1024" -- start
```

**Memory Leak Detection:**
```bash
# Monitor memory usage over time
pm2 monit

# Look for steadily increasing memory usage
# Restart app if memory keeps growing: pm2 restart idling-app
```

### 2. CPU Optimization

**Check CPU Usage:**
```bash
# See overall CPU usage
htop

# Check your app's CPU usage
pm2 show idling-app
```

**CPU Optimization Tips:**
- Restart your app weekly: `pm2 restart idling-app`
- Update Node.js to latest stable version
- Use PM2 cluster mode for better CPU utilization:

```bash
# Start app in cluster mode (uses all CPU cores)
pm2 delete idling-app
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

Create `ecosystem.config.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: 'idling-app',
    script: 'yarn',
    args: 'start',
    instances: 'max', // Use all CPU cores
    exec_mode: 'cluster',
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: 'production'
    }
  }]
}
```

### 3. Network Optimization

**Enable Compression:**
Your Nginx configuration should include:

```bash
# Edit Nginx config
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/idling-app
```

Add compression settings:
```nginx
# Enable compression
gzip on;
gzip_vary on;
gzip_min_length 1024;
gzip_proxied any;
gzip_comp_level 6;
gzip_types
    text/plain
    text/css
    text/xml
    text/javascript
    application/json
    application/javascript
    application/xml+rss
    application/atom+xml
    image/svg+xml;
```

## üì± User Experience Optimizations

### 1. Loading States

**Show Loading Indicators:**
Your app already includes loading states for:
- Page navigation
- Form submissions
- Data fetching
- Image loading

**Skeleton Screens:**
Your app uses smart skeleton loading that:
- Shows placeholders while content loads
- Matches the layout of actual content
- Provides visual feedback to users

### 2. Error Handling

**Graceful Error Handling:**
Your app includes:
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry for failed requests
- Fallback content when something breaks
- Error reporting for fixing issues

### 3. Progressive Enhancement

**Core Functionality First:**
- Basic features work without JavaScript
- Enhanced features load progressively
- App works on slow connections
- Offline functionality where possible

## üîß Development Workflow Optimizations

### 1. Build Process

**Optimize Build Times:**
```bash
# Use development mode for faster rebuilds
yarn dev

# Clear build cache if needed
rm -rf .next
yarn build
```

**Parallel Processing:**
Your build process automatically:
- Processes multiple files at once
- Uses all available CPU cores
- Caches unchanged files
- Optimizes output for production

### 2. Code Quality

**Linting and Formatting:**
```bash
# Check code quality
yarn lint

# Fix formatting issues
yarn prettier
```

**Type Checking:**
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
yarn lint
```

### 3. Testing Performance

**Lighthouse Audits:**
```bash
# Install Lighthouse
npm install -g lighthouse

# Run performance audit
lighthouse https://yourdomain.com --output html --output-path ./lighthouse-report.html
```

**Performance Testing:**
```bash
# Test API response times
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "Total time: %{time_total}s\n" https://yourdomain.com/api/posts

# Test database query times
time psql -h localhost -d mydatabase -U myuser -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM submissions;"
```
