# üîß Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you solve common problems you might encounter when working with idling.app. We've organized solutions by category and provided step-by-step instructions that anyone can follow.

## üéØ How to Use This Guide

**Before you start:**
1. **Read the error message carefully** - it often tells you exactly what's wrong
2. **Check the simple things first** - is your internet working? Is the app running?
3. **Follow the steps in order** - don't skip ahead
4. **Try one solution at a time** - don't change multiple things at once

**What you'll need:**
- Access to your terminal/command line
- Basic knowledge of your operating system
- Patience (some fixes take a few minutes)

## üö® App Won't Start

### Problem: "Missing required environment variables"

**What this means:** Your app is missing important settings it needs to run.

**How to fix:**

1. **Check if you have a .env.local file:**
```bash
# Look for the file in your project root
ls -la .env.local
```

2. **If the file doesn't exist, create it:**
```bash
# Create the file
touch .env.local
```

3. **Add the required variables:**
```bash
# Edit the file
nano .env.local
# Add these lines:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/idling_app_dev"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-development-secret-key"
NODE_ENV="development"
```

4. **Restart your app:**
```bash
# Stop the app (Ctrl+C) and start again
yarn dev
```

### Problem: "Port 3000 already in use"

**What this means:** Another app is already using port 3000.

**How to fix:**

**Option 1: Stop the other app**
```bash
# Find what's using port 3000
lsof -ti:3000

# Stop it (replace XXXX with the process ID from above)
kill -9 XXXX
```

**Option 2: Use a different port**
```bash
# Start on port 3001 instead
yarn dev --port 3001
```

**Option 3: Set a different default port**
```bash
# Add to your .env.local file
PORT=3001
```

### Problem: "Cannot connect to database"

**What this means:** Your app can't reach the database.

**How to fix:**

1. **Check if PostgreSQL is running:**
```bash
# On Linux/Mac
sudo systemctl status postgresql

# On Mac with Homebrew
brew services list | grep postgresql

# On Windows
# Check Windows Services for PostgreSQL
```

2. **Start PostgreSQL if it's not running:**
```bash
# On Linux
sudo systemctl start postgresql

# On Mac with Homebrew
brew services start postgresql
```

3. **Check your database URL:**
```bash
# Make sure your .env.local has the right database URL
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

4. **Test the connection:**
```bash
# Try connecting manually
psql postgresql://localhost:5432/idling_app_dev
```

5. **Create the database if it doesn't exist:**
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
sudo -u postgres psql

# Create the database
CREATE DATABASE idling_app_dev;

# Exit
\q
```

## üîê Authentication Problems

### Problem: "NextAuth configuration error"

**What this means:** The authentication system isn't set up correctly.

**How to fix:**

1. **Check your environment variables:**
```bash
# Make sure these are in your .env.local
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

2. **Generate a proper secret:**
```bash
# Generate a secure secret
openssl rand -base64 32
# Copy the output and use it as your NEXTAUTH_SECRET
```

3. **Make sure the URL matches:**
```bash
# For development
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# For production
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
```

### Problem: "Session keeps expiring"

**What this means:** Your login session doesn't stay active.

**How to fix:**

1. **Check if you changed the secret:**
```bash
# If you changed NEXTAUTH_SECRET, all sessions become invalid
# Users need to log in again - this is normal
```

2. **Clear your browser data:**
```bash
# In your browser:
# 1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
# 2. Go to Application tab
# 3. Clear cookies for your domain
# 4. Clear localStorage
```

3. **Restart your app:**
```bash
# Stop and restart the development server
yarn dev
```

## üìÅ File Upload Issues

### Problem: "File too large"

**What this means:** The file you're trying to upload is bigger than allowed.

**How to fix:**

1. **Check the file size:**
```bash
# Check file size in bytes
ls -la yourfile.jpg
```

2. **Increase the upload limit:**
```bash
# Add to your .env.local
UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB
```

3. **Compress the image:**
```bash
# Use online tools or command line
# For example, using ImageMagick:
convert large-image.jpg -quality 80 -resize 1920x1080 smaller-image.jpg
```

### Problem: "Upload failed"

**What this means:** The file upload didn't work for some reason.

**How to fix:**

1. **Check upload permissions:**
```bash
# Make sure the uploads directory exists and is writable
mkdir -p uploads
chmod 755 uploads
```

2. **Check available disk space:**
```bash
# Make sure you have enough space
df -h
```

3. **Try a different file:**
```bash
# Test with a small text file first
echo "test" > test.txt
# Try uploading this file
```

## üé® UI/Display Problems

### Problem: "Styles not loading" or "App looks broken"

**What this means:** The CSS/styling isn't loading properly.

**How to fix:**

1. **Clear your browser cache:**
```bash
# Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
# Or clear browser cache in settings
```

2. **Check if CSS files are being served:**
```bash
# Open browser developer tools (F12)
# Go to Network tab
# Refresh page
# Look for any failed CSS requests (they'll be red)
```

3. **Restart the development server:**
```bash
# Stop the app (Ctrl+C)
yarn dev
```

4. **Clear Next.js cache:**
```bash
# Delete the cache folder
rm -rf .next
yarn dev
```

### Problem: "Images not displaying"

**What this means:** Images aren't loading on your website.

**How to fix:**

1. **Check the image path:**
```bash
# Make sure images are in the correct folder
ls -la public/images/
```

2. **Check image permissions:**
```bash
# Make sure images are readable
chmod 644 public/images/*
```

3. **Verify the image URL:**
```bash
# In browser, try accessing the image directly
# http://localhost:3000/images/yourimage.jpg
```

## üìä Database Issues

### Problem: "Database migration failed"

**What this means:** The database schema updates didn't apply correctly.

**How to fix:**

1. **Check the migration files:**
```bash
# Look at the migration files
ls -la migrations/
```

2. **Run migrations manually:**
```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
yarn migrate
```

3. **Check database connection:**
```bash
# Make sure you can connect to the database
psql $DATABASE_URL
```

4. **Reset the database (if safe to do so):**
```bash
# WARNING: This deletes all data
# Only do this in development
dropdb idling_app_dev
createdb idling_app_dev
yarn migrate
```

### Problem: "Database queries are slow"

**What this means:** Your database operations are taking too long.

**How to fix:**

1. **Check database indexes:**
```sql
-- Connect to your database
psql $DATABASE_URL

-- Check if indexes exist
\d+ submissions
\d+ users
```

2. **Analyze slow queries:**
```sql
-- Find slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

3. **Restart PostgreSQL:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

## üåê Browser-Specific Issues
