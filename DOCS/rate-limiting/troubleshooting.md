Having trouble with rate limits? This guide will help you diagnose and resolve common issues step by step.

## 🔍 Quick Diagnosis

Start here to quickly identify what type of issue you're experiencing:

### Common Symptoms & Solutions

#### "Rate limit exceeded" messages

- **Cause**: You've hit a hard limit for your current activity
- **Solution**: Wait for the reset time, then reduce your activity pace
- **Prevention**: Monitor your usage and spread activities over time

#### "Please slow down" warnings

- **Cause**: You're approaching your limit
- **Solution**: Reduce your pace slightly and continue
- **Prevention**: Implement natural pacing in your workflow

#### Slow response times

- **Cause**: High system load or approaching limits
- **Solution**: Try again during off-peak hours
- **Prevention**: Plan intensive activities for quieter periods

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### Step 1: Identify the Issue

1. Note the exact error message
2. Record when the issue started
3. Identify what action triggered it
4. Check if it's affecting all features or just specific ones

### Step 2: Quick Fixes

1. **Wait and retry**: Most rate limits reset within 1-15 minutes
2. **Clear browser cache**: Sometimes cached data causes confusion
3. **Try a different browser**: Rule out browser-specific issues
4. **Check your internet connection**: Network issues can compound problems

### Step 3: Analyze Your Usage

1. **Review recent activity**: Have you been more active than usual?
2. **Check for automation**: Are any scripts or tools running?
3. **Multiple sessions**: Are you logged in from multiple devices?
4. **Peak hours**: Are you using the system during busy periods?

## 🌐 Browser-Specific Issues

### Chrome/Edge

- Clear cache: Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
- Disable extensions temporarily
- Try incognito mode

### Firefox

- Clear cache: Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
- Check CORS settings
- Try private browsing

### Safari

- Clear cache: Develop > Empty Caches
- Check cookie settings
- Try private browsing

## 🔌 API Integration Issues

For developers working with the API:

### Check Response Headers

```javascript
// Monitor these headers in API responses
'x-ratelimit-limit'; // Your limit
'x-ratelimit-remaining'; // Requests left
'x-ratelimit-reset'; // When it resets
'retry-after'; // How long to wait
```

### Implement Retry Logic

```javascript
async function apiCall(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);

    if (response.status === 429) {
      const retryAfter = response.headers.get('retry-after');
      console.log(`Rate limited, wait ${retryAfter} seconds`);
      // Implement exponential backoff here
      return;
    }

    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API call failed:', error);
  }
}
```

## 🚨 When to Contact Support

Contact support immediately if you experience:

- **Security blocks** lasting more than 1 hour
- **Repeated false positives** for normal usage
- **System errors** unrelated to rate limiting
- **Account access issues** that persist after waiting

### Information to Provide

When contacting support, include:

- Your account username/email
- Exact error messages
- Time when the issue occurred
- What you were trying to do
- Browser and device information
- Any screenshots of error messages

## 💡 Prevention Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Pace your activities**: Don't rush through bulk operations
2. **Use efficient endpoints**: Choose the most appropriate API calls
3. **Monitor your usage**: Pay attention to system feedback
4. **Plan ahead**: Schedule intensive work during off-peak hours

### For Developers

1. **Implement exponential backoff**: Handle rate limits gracefully
2. **Cache responses**: Avoid repeated identical requests
3. **Batch operations**: Group similar actions together
4. **Monitor rate limit headers**: Track your usage in real-time
