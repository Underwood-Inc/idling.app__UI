# Rich Input System - Business Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Rich Input System is a sophisticated text editing component that transforms basic text input into an intelligent, interactive writing experience. It automatically detects and enhances user content with visual pills for hashtags, user mentions, emojis, and URLs while providing real-time suggestions and auto-completion features.

**Key Business Value:**

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can create rich, interactive content without learning complex syntax
- **Improved Content Discoverability**: Automatic hashtag and mention detection enables better content categorization and user connections
- **Increased Engagement**: Visual feedback and suggestions encourage users to create more structured, searchable content
- **Reduced Friction**: Auto-conversion of URLs and intelligent suggestions minimize manual formatting work
