**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Analysis Scope:** Database optimization for social media-like applications with millions of records

---

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of your current database architecture and extensive research into high-performance database systems, this document provides recommendations for managing millions of records with sub-3-second indexing requirements while maintaining complex relational capabilities.

**Key Findings:**
- Current PostgreSQL setup shows significant performance bottlenecks at scale
- Multiple specialized databases outperform traditional RDBMS for high-write, high-scale workloads
- Hybrid architecture approach recommended for optimal performance and relationship support

## Current Database Structure Analysis

### PostgreSQL Schema Analysis
Based on your migration scripts, your application exhibits:

**Core Data Structure:**
- Primary entity: `submissions` table with complex relationships
- Thread hierarchy support (`thread_parent_id` for nested conversations)
- User relationship tracking (`author_id`, `author`)
- Tag system with array support
- Temporal data with submission timestamps
- Full-text search capabilities

**Performance Optimization Attempts:**
- Extensive indexing strategy (15+ indexes on submissions table)
- Materialized views for user statistics
- Concurrent index creation to minimize downtime
- Compression policies and data retention
- Multiple optimization migrations (0007, 0015, 0016)

**Identified Bottlenecks:**
1. **Write Performance:** Complex index maintenance on every insert/update
2. **Scalability Limits:** Single-node vertical scaling constraints  
3. **Index Bloat:** Multiple indexes causing storage and maintenance overhead
4. **Lock Contention:** High-concurrency write operations blocking reads
